# line-segmentation-of-a-public-transport-network
This project was developed as part of the industrial data valorization module (IND6212) at the Polytechnique Montr√©al engineering university in a group with my top notch teammates (Imed Essid :https://www.linkedin.com/in/imed-essid-729b74167/ et Amadou Mbagnick Sarr ) . In the following link you will find the preliminary database which Imed cleaned and extracted the useful data and for confidentiality reasons I did not have the right to share the final version of  the database with you : https://exo.quebec/fr/a-propos/donnees-ouvertes.
## About the project
Being able to identify similar lines in a public transport network can be important. Additionally, in some cases, transit system planners need to further assess the overall delivery of transit services for review, planning and decision-making purposes; a global vision of the operation is therefore very important, even mandatory. Segmenting lines according to their operational characteristics can provide insightful perspective, which can lead to discovery of different categories or set of line operations. Many bus transport companies such as the STM have segmented their lines into sub-networks, each with well-defined characteristics (local network, express lines, etc.). In this context, we propose to study a database of transmission lines of the company EXO - Laurentides sector which includes a total of 158 lines characterized by 24 columns. The purpose of this work is to help managers and the various intervening parties in the field of bus transport to carry out strategic and operational planning based on groups of similar lines that are those belonging to the same class
in the report attached to the notebook you can find details of all that we have done along this project .
